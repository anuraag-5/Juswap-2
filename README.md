## Juswap (Docker installation)

Just get an alchemy rpc api key from alchemy, and just upgrade to pay as you go plan, this won't cost you money i have been using it from 5 days to test and nothing has cost me.

Just run
**docker pull anuraaag5/juswap2** <br>
**docker run -p 3000:3000 -e NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_API_KEY=<YOUR_RPC_API_KEY> -e NEXT_PUBLIC_JUPITER_API=<YOUR_JUPITER_API_KEY> anuraaag5/juswap2**
